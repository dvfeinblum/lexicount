Contributing
============

This project is pretty nascent right now, so if you really are interested in contributing, color me pleasantly suprised.
That said, feel free to look at the open issues, leave a comment, open a PR, or shoot me an email.

Pull Requests
-------------

Personally, I'm a big fan of branch names that look like:
* `bug/broken-thing` 
* `feature/cool-idea`
* `chore/boring-but-useful-thing`

Open up a PR and fill out the pull request template. Your pull should include changes to the README if needs be.
